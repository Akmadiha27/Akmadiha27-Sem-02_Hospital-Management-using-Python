The **Hospital Management System** is a **Python-based program** that helps manage hospitals and patient data. It allows users to:  

âœ… **View hospital details** (name, city, beds, price, rating, reviews)  
âœ… **Sort hospitals** by price, beds, name, or rating  
âœ… **Search hospitals** in a specific city  
âœ… **View patient data** for each hospital  

The system is **menu-driven**, making it easy to navigate and retrieve information efficiently. ðŸš€
